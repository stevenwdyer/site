    Memorial Baja is building a single-seat off-road Baja SAE racing vehicle to compete in the Baja SAE Ohio competition in September 2026.<br><br>

    The vehicle has an ESP32-S3 microcontroller which connects to an onboard tablet via bluetooth low energy (BLE) to display real time sensor data, such a drive shaft RPM, tempurature, and fuel level, to display to the driver. As an electronics team member, my contributions include:
</p>
<ul class="fs-6 lh-lg dynamic_size_text">
    <li>Devleoped firmware written in C for the ESP32-S3 to measure drive shaft RPM from hall effect sensor data and establish communication to the tablet via BLE.</li>
    <li>Sourced magnet with desired specifications for use with the hall effect sensor to calculate RPM.</li>
    <li>Tested hall effect sensor using multimeters and osciliscopes to ensure accurate sensor readings.</li>
</ul>
